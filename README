Gabriel Fortuna's .vimrc file

I'm putting this out there so that everyone can benefit from years of obsessive
and sustained stubborn effort to make vim as awesome as editors like textmate
and textedit ultra, or whatever newfangled things you kids use nowadays.

A run down of what it does.

1) A tree viewer for your methods and classes. Type tab in normal mode
2) Run and debug SQL statements from within vim - see DBExt on vim.org
3) A file browser. See NERDTree on vim.org. Type \tab in normal mode
4) Sane whitespace conversions. Hard tabs are a bad idea people. This
   .vimrc fixes all that nonsense.
5) A handy commenting plugin. See NERDComments on vim.org
6) A brilliant snippets plugin, ala textmate. See snipMate on vim.org
7) Lots of shortcuts for editing multiple vim screens in a tabbed interface
8) Complete code with tab in insert mode.
9) Lots of other passive enhancements which just make vim more of a pleasure to use
